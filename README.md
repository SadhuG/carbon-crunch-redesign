# Carbon Crunch Task - Redesign

## Objective

This project is continuation of [Carbon Crunch - Task](https://github.com/SadhuG/carbon-crunch-task) for an objectively faster more performant and a subjectively better looking ðŸ˜… website.
Built upon the future optimization suggested in the past submission.

## Live Preview

A live version of the project is hosted on [Vercel](https://carbon-crunch-redesign.vercel.app/).

## Additional Assets & Credits

- **Images/Icons/Fonts:**  
  All external assets used in this project have been uploaded to the repository. These assets are downloaded from [Relume Icons](https://icons.relume.io/) and [Lucide React Icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react).Dashboard Image is part of [Figma Task File](https://www.figma.com/design/mvr8LtX9LWOdTtX1Kco6pN/Task-File---4?node-id=0-1&t=WZ9qJ6dgNBSKNSXw-1) and was hidden in the design. Font DM Sans and Cairo from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans)

## Approach

1. **Design Translation:**  
   I carefully analyzed the [Figma Task File](https://www.figma.com/design/mvr8LtX9LWOdTtX1Kco6pN/Task-File---4?node-id=0-1&t=WZ9qJ6dgNBSKNSXw-1) provided for the task and implemented a complete overhaul of the design to create something modern and minimal while preserving the spirit of the given [Figma Task File](https://www.figma.com/design/mvr8LtX9LWOdTtX1Kco6pN/Task-File---4?node-id=0-1&t=WZ9qJ6dgNBSKNSXw-1) while ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.

   **Changes:**

   - Modern Sans and Sans Serif Fonts
   - Added Gradient and light green background with an extensive green pallet to symbolize sustainability.
   - Used more icons than images to reduce the readers cognitive burden.

2. **Tech Stack & Tools:**  
   The project is built with React + Tailwind CSS + Typescript using Nextjs as the framework of choice. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, ensuring quick iterations and responsiveness. Typescript for type safety in components and props. Next.js for better performance, SEO, accessibility, etc. The code was structured for clarity and reusability.
